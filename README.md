## 🌟 About Me  

Hey! I'm Rakshith — a curious mind who loves making sense of chaos, especially when it comes in the form of **millions of data points**. 💡  
I'm currently decoding the data universe as a **Master’s student in Applied Data Science** at Clarkson University, with hands-on experience in both **industry and research**.

🧩 **Engineer by degree, explorer by choice** — I started out as a Data Engineer, wrangling big data with tools like **Apache Spark, Azure Databricks, and PySpark**, but I quickly found my passion at the intersection of **technology, problem-solving, and storytelling through data**.

🔍 **From Fortune 50 projects to academic research** – I've worked on **high-impact analytics systems** for major enterprises, and now I’m diving into **research projects** that predict material behavior for sustainable construction. Yes, I do build pipelines, but I also help build the future.

💬 Outside the terminal, you’ll find me either:  
- 🏋️‍♂️ Lifting weights at the gym (fitness is my therapy)  
- 📸 Clicking aesthetic shots (former college fest photographer!)  
- 🧠 Thinking about how to build the next cool GenAI agent  
- ♟️ Or deep in a strategy game or cricket match  

I believe in **life-long learning**, **meaningful collaboration**, and using technology to create **tangible, human-centered impact**. Let’s make data do more than just sit in tables — let’s make it *talk*.
